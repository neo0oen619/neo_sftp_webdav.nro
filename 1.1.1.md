# neo_sftp 1.1.1 – Concatenation splits & installer compatibility

- Added support for **Switch concatenation files** on split WebDAV downloads:
  - After downloading a large NSP in split mode (`<name>.nsp/00, 01, ...`), neo_sftp now calls `fsdevSetConcatenationFileAttribute` on the `<name>.nsp` folder.
  - Horizon OS, DBI and Tinfoil can now see that folder as a **single logical NSP**, with the parts concatenated under the hood, so you can install large games from FAT32 SD cards.
- Fixed WebDAV path decoding so `+` characters in filenames are preserved correctly (no more `[B+U393216+16DLC].nsp` turning into a path with spaces).
- Refined WebDAV auto-retry behaviour:
  - Failed downloads on the main connection are auto-retried up to **6 times**, with a total of ~20 seconds of backoff spread across those attempts, before showing the confirm dialog.
  - Keeps long queues moving through transient "Couldn't connect to server" and similar network hiccups.
- Configuration updates:
  - `[Global] webdav_split_large` now defaults to `1` (DBI-style split layout) so large NSPs are safe on FAT32 and still installable by DBI/Tinfoil; exFAT users who prefer single full NSPs can set this back to `0`.
  - `webdav_downloads.md` documents the FAT32 vs exFAT behaviour, recommended settings, and how concatenation files make split NSPs installable on FAT32.
